## Getting Started

It is intended to run on our lab servers
1. icsrl-exxact1.ece.gatech.edu
2. icsrl-srv2.ece.gatech.edu

Lastly there are two things you need to configure before running:
1. Dataset Path
2. Transfer Learning weights

Both of these are available on the server and can be configured by setting the exxact flag in the script.
* *exxact=1* implies you are working on the *exxact* server
* *exxact=0* implies you are working on the *icsrl2* server
