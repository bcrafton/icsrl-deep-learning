extract zips so you have this:
gtFine  gtFine_trainvaltest.zip  leftImg8bit  leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip

run this:
python cityscapes_gluon.py --download-dir /home/brian/Desktop/cityscapes/dataset/

then you will see a good link here:
/home/brian/Desktop/cityscapes/dataset/citys

python cityscapes.py 
Found 2975 images in the folder /home/brian/.mxnet/datasets/citys/leftImg8bit/train
Found 500 images in the folder /home/brian/.mxnet/datasets/citys/leftImg8bit/val
Training images: 2975
Validation images: 500

thought it would be more ? 
> only 3k/5k images or w.e. ? and 11gb ?

want to use the network that used first 8 conv layers from VGG I think.
the one after the network that converted the fc layers to conv layers.
what is the loss function ? 

you want SegNet ... it uses softmax-cross-entropy.
> we have this paper downloaded.

there is 30 classes, so how do we classify ? 
> 480x480x30 ?
> vgg largest activation layer is 224x224x64 ... so i guess this would fit ... must have tiny batches tho.
